This page is used to host some illustrations and animations for my schoolwork, there will not be any technical details provided.

How to read the proofs:

### Problem

Let $$M$$ be mid point of $$AB$$, $$l$$ go through $$M$$ and intersect $$AC$$ at $$N$$. 

Prove that $$N$$ is the mid point of $$AC$$.
